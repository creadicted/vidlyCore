## vidlyCore
This is an .NET Core recreation of [Mosh Hamedanis](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/) Vidly project.
The Original version of this Project is hosted here: https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-mvc-5/ and is created during the [The Complete ASP.NET MVC 5 Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-aspnet-mvc-5-course/learn/v4/overview)

I do this to get used to the changes in .NET Core.
